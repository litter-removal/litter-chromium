  ----------------------------
  
  I, an internet whacko, am using this license to distribute a modified copy of cloudtobutt called "litter."
  
  Litter uses the same walking framework as cloudtobutt, a similar replacement framework, however, litter
  executes an API call to a litter node to evaluate a text for semantic similarity to bots and advertising
  campaigns.
